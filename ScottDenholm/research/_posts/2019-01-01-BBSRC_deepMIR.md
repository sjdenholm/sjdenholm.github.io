## BBSRC Immune Dairy

BBSRC funded project (BB/S009396/1) in collaboration with NAtional Milk Records (NMR) developing predictive models using a Deep Learning approach we will develop a computer pipeline for routine prediction of bTB status from milk MIR spectra, a by-product of routine milk recording.
