        <p align="justify">In September 2013 I started my first postdoc at SRUC working within the Animal and Veterinary Sciences research group as part of
        the Animal Breeding and Genomics team. In April 2015 I moved to the Integrative Animal Sciences team. My background is in
        mathematics, in particular, mathematical biology and epidemiology.</p> 
        
        <p align="justify">I graduated from Heriot-Watt University in 2008 with a BSc in Mathematics. During this my time at Heriot-Watt I studied an
        assortment of subjects in the fields of applied mathematics, pure mathematics and statistics.</p> 
        
        <p align="justify">In 2013 I completed my PhD at the University of Stirling (Defra and Cefas funded) under the supervision of Professor Rachel
        Norman, Dr Andy Shinn, Dr Andy Hoyle and Dr Nick Taylor. My research at Stirling involved using mathematical modelling techniques
        to investigate the long-term impact of Gyrodactylus salaris infections on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations in
        territories currently free from infection such as the United Kingdom.</p> 
        
        <p align="justify">Currently I am interested in the use of immune traits as potential markers for health and welfare traits in dairy cattle.
        I also have interests in relationships between immune traits and hard/expensive to record phenotypic traits such as energy
        balance. In summary my interests, have and still, lie in using applied mathematical and statistical methods to better understand
        biological systems with an emphasis on health, disease (and disease dynamics), systems biology, analysis of big data and
        genetics.</p>
