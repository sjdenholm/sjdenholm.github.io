## Logan's Run <img align="right" src="/blog/img/loganscott.png">

Today I offically turned 30 years old. I am now an adult and must do "adult" things (*note to self: learn adult things to do*) - is waking up with a slight hangover okay to do?

I was surprised last night by my beautiful girlfriend and my pals with a an impromtu birthday drinking session (luckily I always take my birthday as a holiday). It was a great night and the perfect way to bring in 30 years of existance.

Today started with a nice lie in followed by a birthday breakfast...
