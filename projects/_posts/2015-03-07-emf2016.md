## Running Man

As a personal challenge I decided to enter the 2016 Edinburgh Half Marathon. I have but one aim - **beat the sweeper bus** and thus finish within the time limit of 3 hours and 15 minutes.

Having never done any kind of long distance or competative running (and not being the fittest of humans) I felt this would be a tough but acheivable goal if I put in the training and effort.
