## Running Man <img align="right" src="/projects/img/8bitscottemf.png">
As a personal challenge I decided to enter the 2016 [Edinburgh Half Marathon]{:target="_blank"}. I have but one aim - **beat the sweeper bus** and thus finish within the time limit of 3 hours and 15 minutes.

Having never done any kind of long distance or competative running (and not being the fittest of humans) I felt this would be a tough but acheivable goal if I put in the training and effort.


Race number - 33405

finishing position - 7878

**Finishing time - 02:34:48**

10km time - 01:09:42
