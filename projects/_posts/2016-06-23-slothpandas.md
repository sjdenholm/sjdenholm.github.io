## Fuddy Ruckers!

Following on from my previous 2016 physical challenge [Edinburgh Half Marathon]{:target="_blank"} I decided to join some pals who had signed up for the 2016 [Total Warrior]{:target="_blank"} mud run. This is a 12km assault course which I guess is the same idea of Tough Mudder and similar events... **Enter the SLOTH PANDAS ROM HELL!**


### 24/07/2016 - Official training started
Today I started my training to get ready for the mud run. Having not done very much in the way of exercise since the half marathon in May I found my first long run quite tough. Finished 10km in 01:11:13 in the rain - not as good as my half marathon 10km but only about 2 mins off. 


### 26/07/2016
In addition to the endurance aspect of the run there is also the core strength requiremet! Got back in to body pump at my gym to train the muscles. Pull ups and push ups are now being encourporated into my daily routine ~(>_<~) :dizzy_face:


### 31/07/2016
Second training run completed. Was aiming to beat last weeks time. Finished the 10km this week in 01:08:02 - a personal best!
