# So I decided to build my very own pedalboard ...

... Well I guess I *actually* decided this a few years ago going by the many "blueprints" I have. Recently though I stumbled on an old HarmonyCentral post where one of their members hacked an IKEA shelf into their very own Pedaltrain-style pedalboard. Seeing how effective this hack is, and the multiple similar and successful projects carried out by others, I decided to have a shot myself.

Now two of best things about this pedalboard are the cost and the customizability (is that a real word?):

### The cost
The majority of these boards I read about on the information super highway were made in America where the shelf of choice is the IKEA Gorm. Over the pond here in Scotland, however, this shelf is not available but a similar costing alternative is, in the form of the . At only Â£5 a pop for a two pack you can't complain! 
###### IKEA actually sell two sizes of these shelves a 3 plank and a 5 plank so if you have a hoard of pedals then the 5 may be a better choice. I chose the 3 plank version.

### Customizability
Baisically the pedalboard can be as small or large as you require. You can attach multiple units together and create a massive board or you can cut it right down to a board that will only house 2 or 3 pedals. Naturally, you can paint it any colour(s) you choose; decide how you want to stick the pedals to it; decide whether or not it will have it's own power pack, inputs/outputs, lights, handles. You can create it so that it fits into an old carry, flight, or suit case - or even build a custom case/case top for it! The possibilities are pretty much endless and a quick Google image search for "IKEA pedalboard" will sure get the creative juices flowing.

Some diy-ers cut their boards to size based on the number of pedals they are wanting it to house, however, I want to make mine a bit more future proof such that if I get a new pedal (who are we kidding with the "if"!) then I can just attach it without banishing an older pedal to the land of "Under Bed".
